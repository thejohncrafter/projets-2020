# Parser generation crate

Provides two [procedural macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/reference/procedural-macros.html)
to define lexers and parsers.

This crate is used internally in the projects that live in this repo, and is not
mature enough to support general-purpose lexer/parser generation. As it is,
it is more hacky stuff than well-written code...

I would love to come back on this later and turn it into a really
powerful parser generator, but for now it will remain an internal helper.
